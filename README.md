# ERRNet
This repo contains the codes for the submission of Pattern Recognition journal.

## Introduction

In this work, we propose a Edge-based Reversible Re-calibration Network (ERRNet) for camouflaged object detection. 
It consists of a selective edge aggregation (SEA) module and a reversible re-calibration unit (RRU), which are 
cooperating closely with NEGS priors (i.e., Neighbour prior, Global prior, Edge prior, and Semantic prior) at 
low-/high-level layers. The SEA aggregation strategy is exploited to mine the edge prior and prevent the weakness edge
vanishing problem, while the RRU is responsible for re-calibrating the coarse prediction. Our ERRNet reaches the 1st 
place on three COD datasets, and also outperforms existing cutting-edge models on ve medical image segmentation
datasets. Further, we have provided comprehensive ablation studies, making ERRNet a general and robust architecture in the COD task.
